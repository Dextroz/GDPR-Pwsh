## Dependencies

The function on it's own doesn't require any dependencies. However, if you use the app, it requires the [AnyBox](https://github.com/dm3ll3n/AnyBox) module. When executing `Show-GdprPwsh`, the function will attempt to install AnyBox for you if it is not present on the host. 

## Installation

```powershell
Import-Module -Name "{Full Path}\GDPR-Pwsh\GDPR-Pwsh" -Verbose
```
